# Description of the Challenge for Exercise 02

Convert string to Pig Latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and **ay** is add, so **first** becomes **irst-fay**. Words that start with a vowel have **hay** add to the end instead (**apple** becomes **apple-hay**). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 enconding!
